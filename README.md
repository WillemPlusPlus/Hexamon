This repository contains the codebase for Hexamon, a game platform I wrote to help teach kids how to code. The course was run in-school in collaboration with the teachers who facilltated lessons. If your'e interested in the lesson materials feel free to say hi at hello@wllm.info

If you'd like to see the "game" in action, this version is configured to run as a ecosystem sandbox battle-royale using some example creatures. You can check by opening dist/index.html in a local web server
